This project is basically on a game store management system using distributed database. It is a system for a game store which performs different functionalities such as storing customer info, branch info, sales info, products info etc. Here, I have given an overview of our project including my contribution and other functionalities of the project. Further info is given below, step by step:

<h3> There are two basic sides in this project:</h3> 

<h4>Host Side</h4>
The admin can control the system as a whole with some levels of distribution transparency. The tables are: 
<li>Products</li>
<li>Developers</li>
<li>Categories</li>
<li>Invoice </li>
<li>Employees</li>

<h4>Site Side</h4>
There are two sites in this system. They are distributer  platform wise, either centrally or branch wise.
In our project our game store has two branches. One is Site5 and the other site6.  One branch can’t access other branch’s info, only the host can access both of them.
